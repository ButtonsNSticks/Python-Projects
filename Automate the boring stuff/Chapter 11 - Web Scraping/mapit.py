"""The command line arguments will be stored in the variable sys.argv.
The 1st item in the sys.argv list should always be a string containing the programâ€™s filename
('mapit.py'), and the 2nd item should be the first command line argument, the third item is the 2nd argument
and so on.

Command ine arguments are separated by spaces - but here we need ALL of them in ONE string to pass to
Google Maps. As sys.argv is a list of strings, we can join them together using the .join method.
As sys.argv[0] is the name of the script, we don't want that but we do want all of the other items in the list
so we need to use sys.argv[1:] as this will give us the 2nd item in the list and all others which follow."""
